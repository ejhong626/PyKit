# PyKit
PyKit is a collection of "improved" modules from basic functions in the language.
We are aware that there are existing modules that do the same thing as what we have here. However, those powerful modules still remain a black box function so this project mostly serves as a practice to better understand the language.
What we do here gives us more flexibility and understanding of the language to better support any future projects.
